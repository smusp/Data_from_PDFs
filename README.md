The paper presents a basic three-variable mediation analysis. The R files demonstrate the extraction from a table of means, staandard deviations, and correlations for the three variables. Arguably, it would be quicker and simpler to copy the means, standard deviations , and correlations into R. The purpose is to outline the process for a simple case.

The paper presenst a two-group, two-construct factor model. Each construct is assessed with three manifest indicators. The R files demonstrate the extraction of means, standard deviations, variable names, and correlations, not from a table but from LISREL script.
